TXL

TXL is a unique programming language specifically designed to support computer software analysis and source transformation tasks. It is the evolving result of more than fifteen years of concentrated research on rule-based structural transformation as a paradigm for the rapid solution of complex computing problems.

The TXL programming language is a hybrid functional / rule-based language with unification, implied iteration and deep pattern match.

Txl is required for Nicad that Bumper uses.
